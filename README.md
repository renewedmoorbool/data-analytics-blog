# data-analytics-blog
In this project I will be discussing about Data Analytics concepts through a simple HTML-based blog.


At least in the beginning, CSS will be non-existent, except for some minor details. The reason is that I want to focus on the content of the blog, trying to understand as much as I can of this world. It is an exercise for me to gain insight on the Data Analytics aspect of our reality and to 
practice Git and Github. 

Looking forward to learn new things,
