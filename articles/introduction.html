            Some steps are required to achieve success in a <em> data-driven </em> project. <br>
            Data needs to be processed through a sequence: 

            <ol>
                 <li> 
                    Data <strong> needs </strong> to be prepared and cleaned.
                     This involves retrieving it, organizing it in a structure.
                 </li>

                 <li>
                     Data <strong> has to be </strong> analyzed. This might 
                     involve <em> statistical analysis.</em> <br> 
                     The analysis has to be centered around a specific topic, <br> 
                     like a business question that may be asked.
